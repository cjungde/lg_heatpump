# identical one was answered in 1 ms (a real answer takes 36 ms or more) and the
# shift showed the old value for 60 s, until the next settings poll. A gateway
# that answers repeated requests from a cache would do that. The retries run in

# Home Assistant's modbus integration serialises every consumer of one gateway
# behind a single lock, so waiting time adds up instead of overlapping. The
# library default is 10 s. A reply that arrives after the client gave up is read
# as the answer to the NEXT request ("Received unexpected response with
# Transaction ID") and the link drops. 20 s is a floor, not an assignment: the
# link takes the largest value any unit on it asks for, so this never shortens
# anyone else's.
